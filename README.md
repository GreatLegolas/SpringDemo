# SpringDemo
My first demo on Spring Boot lead by Nelson (amigoscode). While it is done be following the lesson there were moments that I have managed by myself due to, I suppose, difference in the version of IntelliJ IDEA (I have the community edition, Nelson showed it using ultimate edition of the IDE) and the operating systems (mine is Win10 while Nelson used MacOS).
